One of the first programs I wrote. This was back in 2000 (I was 15yo). I had recently found a Pascal book and started to learn the language. As I was studying Latin in school (and really enjoyed its grammar), I wrote this program that inflects Latin nouns. Pretty useless, but I keep it as a memory. :)
